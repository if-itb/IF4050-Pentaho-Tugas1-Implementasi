# Pentaho BI CE - CDE (Community Dashboard Editor)


## Development Environment

- Pentaho CE (Business Analytics Platform)


## Description

Community Dashboard Editor (CDE) is the Dashboard editor created and used everyday by the Webdetails team. With CDE, you can start building your own CTools Dashboards in a fast and effective way.

CDE was born to simplify the CTools Dashboards' creation, edition and rendering processes, and it's a very powerful and complete tool, combining front end with data sources and custom components in a seamless way.

CDE has three perspectives :

1. Layout : Designing the layout of your dashboard such as the ```styles (css)``` and the positioning of the ```layout (html)```.

2. Components : Add and set up the different components that make up your dashboard: ```Visual Components (textboxes, tables, charts, etc.)```, ```Parameters``` and ```Scripts```.

3. Datasources : Define the ```data sources``` used by the components (sql, cda, olap4j, etc).


## How to Preview

1. At first, open ```localhost:8080/pentaho``` and input your ```username``` and ```password```.

2. After that, go to the ```browse files``` and upload all of files in ```Pentaho BI CE - CDE``` folder.

3. Then, ```File -> Open -> Cde Dashboard``` and you will see the example dashboard that created using the CDE.


## Additional Notes

The ```data``` is taken from Pentaho BI CE sample data.
